Overview
```
This project Next Word Prediction aims to develop an AI-powered text generation model using deep learning techniques. The model will be trained on a merged dataset consisting of four classic literature books - Jane Eyre, Metamorphosis, Pride and Prejudice, and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The objective is to generate new text based on the patterns learned from the training data.

```
Methodology
```
The model will be developed using deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. The training data will be preprocessed by tokenizing and converting it into sequences to be fed into the model. The model will then be trained on the sequences, and its performance will be evaluated based on its ability to generate new text that resembles the training data.

```
Business Segments
```
The AI-powered text generation model has various potential applications in different business segments. It can be used in content creation for marketing, advertising, and social media campaigns. It can also be used to generate personalized messages for email marketing or chatbots. Additionally, it can be used to generate news articles or other written content for the media industry.

```
AI application
```
The AI-powered text generation model will be developed using Python programming language and TensorFlow library. The model will be trained using GPU-accelerated computing to improve performance. The final model will be able to generate new text based on a given prompt, which can be used in various applications such as content creation, marketing, and media.

```
Data
```
The training data consists of four classic literature books, including Jane Eyre, Metamorphosis, Pride and Prejudice, and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

The dataset was preprocessed by removing special characters, double quotes, and extra blank spaces to improve data quality. The data was then tokenized and converted into sequences for training the deep learning model.

Papers
```
The development of the AI-powered text generation model is based on various research papers in the field of deep learning and natural language processing. The papers include "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le, and "Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling" by Jozefowicz, R., Vinyals, O., Schuster, M., Shazeer, N., & Wu, Y.
